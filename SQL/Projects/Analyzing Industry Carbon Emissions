Description:
Product emissions make up more than 75% of global emissions. But which industries are the worst offenders?

Use this dataset alongside your Intermediate SQL skills to find out!

Greenhouse gas emissions attributable to products—from food to sneakers to appliances—make up more than 75% of global emissions. -The Carbon Catalogue

Our data, which is publicly availably on nature.com, contains product carbon footprints (PCFs) for various companies. PCFs are the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to a given product, measured in CO2 (carbon dioxide equivalent).

This data is stored in a PostgreSQL database containing one table, prouduct_emissions, which looks at PCFs by product as well as the stage of production these emissions occured in. Here's a snapshot of what product_emissions contains in each column:

product_emissions

field	data_type
id	VARCHAR
year	INT
product_name	VARCHAR
company	VARCHAR
country	VARCHAR
industry_group	VARCHAR
weight_kg	NUMERIC
carbon_footprint_pcf	NUMERIC
upstream_percent_total_pcf	VARCHAR
operations_percent_total_pcf	VARCHAR
downstream_percent_total_pcf	VARCHAR
You'll use this data to examine the carbon footprint of each industry in the dataset!

Solution:
SELECT industry_group, count(company) as count_industry, round(sum(carbon_footprint_pcf),1) as total_industry_footprint
FROM product_emissions
where year=2017
group by industry_group
order by total_industry_footprint desc;
