Description:
Motorcycles—cool! SQL skills—definitely cool! This project allows you to combine both—very cool!
Working on behalf of a company that sells motorcycle parts, you'll dig into their data to help them understand their revenue streams. 
You'll build up a query to find out how much net revenue they are generating across their product lines, segregating by date and warehouse.

Solution:
with cte as (
SELECT industry, extract('year' from date_joined) as year,
count(*) as num_unicorns, round(avg(valuation)/1000000000,2) as average_valuation_billions
from dates
join funding using(company_id)
join industries using(company_id)
where extract('year' from date_joined) in ('2019', '2020', '2021')
group by industry, year
)
select *
from cte
where industry in (
select industry
from (
select industry, sum(num_unicorns) as s
from cte
group by industry
order by s desc
limit 3
) t
)
order by industry, year desc
