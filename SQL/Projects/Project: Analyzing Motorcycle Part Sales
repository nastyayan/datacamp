!!DO NOT FORGET TO USE RTRIM FUNCTION FOR TO_CHAR FUNCTION AS DATACAMP DOES NOT ACCEPT ANSWER WITH TRAILING SPACES!!

SELECT product_line, rtrim(to_char(date, 'Month')) as month, warehouse,
round(sum(total*(1-payment_fee))::numeric,2) as net_revenue
FROM sales
where client_type='Wholesale'
group by product_line, month, warehouse
order by product_line, month, net_revenue desc;
